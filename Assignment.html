		Dogs can have many positive effects on the lives of their owners. They influence social, emotional,
		and cognitive development in children, promote an active lifestyle, provide companionship, and have 
		even been able to detect oncoming epileptic seizures or the presence of certain cancers. Dogs can also 
		help to relieve stress and anxiety in people. Around 38% of US households are estimated to have one or more dogs.
